11/2/2022,1667414584,How much do I have to like the I side to realistically enjoy working in IO? Am I considering IO for the right reasons?,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for any sage advice and honest opinions I can garner on this. Any input is seriously appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I've recently started considering IO as a career path, after much waffling following my undergrad. I cycled through previous interests of academic research and mental health counseling, ultimately nixing both ideas due to their downsides and potential for burnout seemingly outweighing my interest in them. I started an internship after graduation with a DoD contractor for additional research experience/to further rule out research as a career prospect.

I hadn't given IO any thought until I started my internship and got talking to IOs and learned about what lead them to the field. I previously thought it would be exceedingly dry, as I don't consider myself passionate about statistics nor businesses. Generally speaking, though, I've enjoyed witnessing the tangible outcomes of applied research while I've done my internship, and the idea of using psychology to problem solve is appealing to me. I've realized that my ultimate goal in pursuing a career in psychology would be to help people become happier, healthier and more productive, and I can't help but wonder if something within IO could be an actionable means of achieving that goal while having a wider reach and actually making a visible difference. I'm just not sure if that notion is too idealistic for this field, though.

This leads to the title questions--in the bit of research I've done thus far about IO, I already know I'm  more O-leaning in my interests. My pipe dream would be to run a consulting business that focuses mainly on augmenting things like employee satisfaction, work-life balance, mental health and the like, but I know that isn't realistic, given that I-sided things that systematically affect the bottom line seem like they'd be in much higher demand. I don't think I totally despise *all* I-sided things, though currently it's hard to say without having any experience. I'd like to think I could get myself to ""suffer through it"", viewing things like assessment/productivity as necessary evils, but that could be an extremely misguided notion.

**Am I being naive to be looking into IO? Should I be looking elsewhere if I'm not passionate about industrial psych?**

**As an IO, what specific aspects/sub-topics of IO do you enjoy the most? Do you find yourself working on these often?**

**Were there any particular sub-topics that initially drew you to the field? Is there anything you particularly dislike but are able to tolerate about IO?**

*Edit: Thank you all for your honest thoughts on this! Since this post I've started the applications process for Masters programs in I/O, and these responses were really encouraging to come back to as I've started the interview process.

For background, theyre a Fortune 100 company, Ive been interning since May and have won several intern competitions, so have racked up some nice accolades. I dont say that to brag, just to state that I think the offer is somewhat warranted, as I am performing at a level that the company finds valuable, and so I believe I may have some wiggle room to negotiate this offer.

I know that on paper, that is a good offer, and I doubt Ill get a better one straight out of grad school. However, I am overthinking this a bit and becoming worried. The role itself is completely undefined, as the company doesnt have a natural position open, so I will sort of be filling in where my skills are needed in the department hiring me. This is alright, but there is high potential of me primarily doing things like event planning, scheduling calls for the team, and otherwise not using the skills I have developed in my I/O program.

12/19/2022,1671467364,Message to IO Students: Don't let imposter syndrome discourage you,"I'm about five years out of grad school and have been doing a lot of personal reminiscing on my time in my program. As much as I appreciate my degree and the folks I met, looking back on my work and how I felt during that time made me compelled to make this post for anyone who may be going through what I did so long ago. 

My biggest struggle in grad school was confidence - this is a universal feeling for a lot of grads, but for myself, it genuinely impeded my ability to contribute to projects, voice my thoughts in class, and overall build important skills that academics alone cannot teach you. I truly felt like I didn't belong there and that my thoughts and ideas were not as ""intelligent"" as my other classmates. The reality was, however, that my classmates and I were really all on the same level - we all got into the program and did just fine outside of it. The anxiety I felt during the program, while understandable, was harmful to my growth and my ability to truly connect with my classmates to extent I look back on my time at school with a bit of regret. I didn't truly feel confident in my work until after a year or two in the professional setting, but so much of that could have come from my time in grad school as well.

My case may be a bit on the extreme side but it goes without saying that if there's any advice I can give to incoming folks, it's to make friends with your cohort and make an effort to *learn* both inside the classroom and outside. You may feel the same way I did, and those *feelings* are valid, but your behavior does not have to be influenced by that. Your classmates will appreciate your input and your effort and your questions. Bring to your classes and your projects things you have learned on your own time and your own experiences - the cool thing about IO Psych is that you can really relate it to just about anything.  Don't be afraid of feeling dumb - the stats and research classes are hard for just about everyone and it is 100% okay to acknowledge that. Willingness to learn and trying your absolute best to build relationships and be a good ""team player"" goes *miles* in these kinds of programs.

Just food for thought that I wanted to share - I hope it is helpful to some of you. Happy Holidays!",IOPsychology,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/zpw5u4/message_to_io_students_dont_let_imposter_syndrome/

Having an emotional attachment to your employing organization (known as affective commitment) has been associated with lower levels of absenteeism and #turnover intentions as well as higher levels of #jobsatisfaction, job involvement, wellbeing, and a tendency to go above &amp; beyond the call of duty.

"" Studies show that employees emotional attachment to an employer has a positive impact on their attitudes and actions.

"" Employees who view their organizations culture highly are more likely to be committed to their employing organization.

"" Organizations should focus on providing defined roles and job clarity, social support and autonomy to employees to increase commitment to the organization.

Trustworthiness Score:

We critically evaluated the trustworthiness of the rapid evidence assessment we used to inform this Evidence Summary. We found the result that affective commitment has a small to moderate effect on a range of work-related outcomes and the factors which lead to affective commitment to be consistent across multiple meta-analyses and primary studies. Therefore, we can conclude the rapid evidence assessment of what is known in the scientific literature about affective commitment is highly trustworthy. In the aggregate, we believe that the evidence from many meta-analytic studies offers a substantial level of trust in the body of evidence reviewed.",IOPsychology,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/zhavc1/a_new_scienceforwork_article_audio_episode_see/

&amp;#x200B;

I am making a list of the top 15 most influential articles/books in the history of personnel selection. I would love some more input from SMEs.

**\*\*If you suggest one please justify)\*\***

Here are some I have chosen/am considering:  
\- Munsterberg (1910/1913) (OG selection, arguably the first published work on selection studies)  
\- Schmidt and Hunter 1998 ( meta-analysis of nearly 100 years of research highlight valid practices)

 \*\*debating also their 1992/1977

  
\- Barrick, M. R., &amp; Mount, M. K. (1991).  Finally addressed the controversy/disapproval of personality testing in selection  
\- Dunnetts' 1963 new selection mode since munsterberg 

\-Bray and Moses 1972: shifted our approach to how we look at validity/fairness.

\-wagner 1949: support of the structured interview

\- I also have a list of possible influential psychologists but I am having trouble settling on which publications from them to include: Flanagan, Bringham, Guion, Campion, Viteles, Kaurnhauser or Freyd. Also more modern ones like Highhouse, Salgado, etc.   


Would love input whether it is new or old!

Any pro-labor shifts such as shorter workweek and increased pay would have to come from someone higher up than people in our position. 

Another example is that Walmart shooting article that hit this page recently. HR can set policies for reporting these behaviors, but gun laws are political and this seems more like a mental health or security issue than anything else.

11/23/2022,1669164075,20 years experience in corporate leadership training has taught me that 95% of it is a massive waste of money!," Group leadership workshops are TERRIBLY inefficient at reaching positive outcomes: You've seen them, been to them and maybe (like me) have even sold and run them yourself. If so, this will be familiar; 20 - 30 leaders in a room over three days with a curriculum that mixes strategy, capability uplift, innovation, values and motivation.

I worked for a company that delivered large-scale training to big enterprises, including the largest account (worth over 30M annually on one client). Watching my peers working on similar accounts highlighted an embarrassing level of value, that most clients didn't care enough about to change.

I need to share why they are a horrible idea:

· **Direct costs**

20 - 30 leaders, 3 days out of the business is very expensive, Then you include travel, events and accommodation and that three-day workshop averages about $5,000 per leader. Multiply that by X leaders (3,000 was typical for us), and the direct costs alone make it incredibly difficult to reach an adequate ROI.

· **Leadership training tries to be all things to everyone, and ends up little to nothing to most**

Large-scale training is usually broken up into various learning journeys, that are typically different levels of seniority, the curriculum is slightly different, but there is a high degree of consistency (typically by design). That means that even the different cohorts have a variety of leaders that have:

1. vastly different levels of capability  some are ninjas at strategy but have to sit through half a day on the latest strategic framework. Within the same room, there are people that need basic level knowledge in strategic thinking that requires more than a 2-hour session. This is the same with literally every other capability; the worst offender was E,Q with such a HUGE range of levels of proficiency. You could typically map 10 - 15 capabilities to a typical workshop, and the same dynamic occurs in each and every capability.
2. vastly different capability needs in their role  sitting through the same curriculum means that leaders are exposed to a large chunk of skills that have absolutely no impact on the performance of their current role or career path.

· **It's very difficult to demonstrate an ROI**

There are so many different variables that impact a capability uplift, so EVEN IF a training program has pre and post-measures with a 360 review, it's impossible to scientifically equate an ROI with a specific workshop.

· **Knowledge transference on hard skills (even when measured) demonstrates a poor ROI**

A new hard skill is learned in the three-day workshop, e.g.; design thinking, which can be very valuable. The key points are so lost amongst the larger curriculum that has been slammed down people's throats that the typical experience (from our surveys) is that learners turn to YouTube to bridge the massive knowledge gap.

· **The opportunity cost of time and money that could've been redirected elsewhere**

I've nothing further to add here&

· **But you say it's about the relationships that people develop in the room!**

There are much cheaper and much more effective ways to achieve that!

· **But you say the lack of training is one of the significant issues in engagement in every company, so we have to do it!**

Even those companies that spend a lot on large-scale group workshops find there is a very minor impact on engagement results because the training they do just isn't relevant enough to the learner's capability, their role and their career path.

As someone who has profited from running these big programs in the past, I feel like I've wasted my own time and that of the learners, not to mention the massive waste of money. I feel like I'm having a crisis of conscience, not only being a participant, but watching every provider who operates in this field, selling large-scale group training.

How often do org's develop inhouse technical knowledge assessments, SJTs, etc.?

Do you use hurdles in your selection processes? 

Do you focus on high cost roles? Or, do you focus on roles entry level roles with low recruitment?

Personally, I/O was always something on my radar, yet nothing I've really looked too much into. However, after talking with my professor, the description seems appealing. Maybe I'm just off the mark and need to do more research, but basically what I've gathered is that Industrial Psychologists are hired by big businesses and organizations to basically monitor and improve the mental health of the company by looking at data and proposing change. Do the stuff that keeps Disney's turnover rate the lowest ever, right? Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm not without my own observations of possible applications with the field. I'm still a young man who enjoys his video games, so an example of a business who I think could desperately need one is Blizzard, given the controversy that company always finds itself in. For those who know what I'm talking about, is that a situation where an Industrial Psychologist could be beneficial? Just to clarify my beliefs on what an Industrial Psychologist does.

I initially came to this school because they had a graduate program in the field I would eventually like to go into (Industrial-Organizational Psychology) so I knew I would be able to get undergraduate research experience and make good connections that could help me on my way to graduate school. This school gave me a great academic scholarship and was the cheapest option out of all the schools I applied to. My main problem is that after I got here, I found out in my first week that the graduate program in Industrial-Organizational Psychology is being phased out. The last new cohort was accepted this year; after they graduate, the program will no longer exist. This means I am going to have less access to research opportunities and mentors. I am really been interested in going into the research side of this field, and I worry that without solid undergraduate research opportunities, my chances of getting into graduate school will suffer.

A few more notes: Financially, I am very lucky and grateful to say that my parents have supported my education, so that I do not have any student loans right now. However, they said that if I transfer, they will have me take loans out to pay any difference in price between my old school and new school, which I can understand and Im not going to argue with as they already support me so much. I know that many people take out student loans, but I still worry if it will be worth it. I also really do not want to stay in Ohio. Like, at all. Most internship opportunities from my school are here in Ohio, instead of my home state (which I would like to stay in and work in down the road).

I am at least going to stay at this school through the Fall 2023 semester since I already have housing set up, but I would love some opinions on what I should do in the long run. Do you think transferring somewhere larger/more research focused would be the best choice for me, or will I be fine staying where I am?

I am an Irish masters student of Work &amp; Organisational Psychology and I am looking for voluntary participants to take part in important research.

My studies are focused on improving the workplace for employees by offering evidence-based suggestions to organisations. This is achieved through the study of human and organisational behaviour.

I am conducting research to identify ways organisations can support employees' Work Ability (employee perceptions of their ability to continue working in their current job).

I will also be researching if the different dimensions of perceived Work Ability (physical, cognitive, interpersonal and emotional) relate to presenteeism, to understand why employees engage in presenteeism.

I am seeking to recruit as many volunteer participants as possible to take part in this by completing 4 surveys at 4 different time points in the coming months. The survey takes \~15 minutes to complete.

As we wish to contact you for the follow-up surveys, you will be asked to provide your email address. This will be held securely and confidentially and will be used for research purposes only. Your responses will be completely confidential, only accessible by the research team and responses will be anonymised once the final data collection has been completed.

My department's lab is relatively new and has just started operating. We're interested in occupational health, employee performance, job resources, and remote work. Recently we've started a project about micro-breaks' effect on performance, but the plan is to extend our research scope.  

We already have some tools that are commonly used in our country for occupational testing (primarily for drivers), like Piorkowski-type and cross-type machines (for reaction time), stereometer (for spatial differentiation), Poppelreuter boards (for focus and divisibility of attention), MPR meter (for response to visual and auditory stimuli), and Vienna Tests System.

1/25/2023,1674662390,Employee creativity as way to deal with crises at work: The case of covid-19,"A recently published study ([download full text here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10400419.2022.2137209)) suggests that, rather than being something ""whimsical"", creativity is simply a way to address actual problems at work and to improve one's quality of (working) life. 

The study makes a distinction between incremental creativity (= minor modifications in your work) and major creativity (= major modifications in your work). All respondents were asked to compare their levels of creativity before and after covid-19 broke out. The findings suggest that when employees report increases in their incremental creativity, they also report increases in their personal development (= better job performance and more learning) and also in their wellbeing (= less exhaustion). When respondents report increases in their radical creativity, they only report increases in their personal development (so not on their well-being). As a conclusion, because major creativity is rather demanding, it is only capable of boosting one's performance (and not necessarily one's well-being). But incremental creativity seems to have the potential to boost both.

Last but not least, one unexpected finding seems to suggest that employees who were proactive (taking immediate action) but also mindful (present in the ""now"") reported higher levels of incremental creativity. This suggests that in order to be creative, people don't only need to be proactively searching for solutions (= proactivity) but they also need to be open to and to observe their environment (= mindfulness). In other words, action and reflection need to go hand in hand.",IOPsychology,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/10l1zx5/employee_creativity_as_way_to_deal_with_crises_at/

1/11/2023,1673444874,Need help with the right approach for measuring employee's motivation (+ does anyone have the MWMS scale scoring?),"Hello everyone,

Right now, I've been tasked with measuring the employees' motivation at the company I work at. 

Motivation is a global term and the explanation for the need for such a thing has been pretty vague and global too. Basically, the idea is that we get a sense for whether our employees are motivated intrinsically or externally (to top it off, is it directly salary that motivates them or something else that's material). 

From my own search, I've stumbled upon the Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale (MWMS) created by Gagné et al. (2015). The scale is based off of the Self-Determination Theory. I have gotten the scale via official means (The SDT organization website) but it didn't contain any scoring. From my research, basically there are 5 scores/subscales which correspond with each factor. Those scores are represented by the mean of all items in a subscale. Am I correct here?

My questions are:

1.) Has anyone else tried using this scale in an organizational context? Has it provided you with valuable info?

* The idea is that I can see, on average, where the employees are in terms of their motivation, so that we can develop some suggestions for further rewarding practices or attempts at modifying the work design (in order to make it more interesting). From my reading, the MWMS has been linked with turnover intention. So, we'd be able to identify turnover risks.

2.) Are there any other relevant motivation scales that would be more adequate?

3.) Would you recommend, atop of this scale, to use the Job Content Questionnaire?

* There is a scale which is derived from JCQ and has been psychometrically validated in my language. It is shorter and it focuses mostly on psychological demands, as well as the job control (i.e. how much control over my work I have). This scale has been linked with work motivation. Considering that it's a very economic scale (relatively short), I was thinking to using it to get a clearer sense of the whole pictures. I'm wondering is there a correlation between work motivation and the psychological demand/job control in my organization? Which aspects of the work are potentially poor? And so on.

This is my first relevant project at my first job, so I'm trying to contribute something to my company but also I don't want to just do surveys for the sake of doing them.

A significant reason I uncovered for not feeling valued at work were poor interpersonal relationships between managers/colleagues. However, I'm a bit confused here because relationships are classified as a 'hygiene factor', whilst feeling 'valued' is classified as a 'motivating' factor.

We did extremely poorly in Equality and Inclusion, Communication/Trust Respect, and Teamwork. I did a follow-up survey to get in depth answers and the feedback is not good. I want to know how to fix these issues. Some background...over the past three years we've had three CEOs. The first retired and had been working at the organization for 20 years. The second hired many of his buddies, paid them huge salaries, changed major processes without much input from existing staff. He left. We went through a period where we were CEO-less which required many senior staff to step up in ways they had not before. Now we have a new CEO and some of the previous CEO's friends still work here. There is a huge power struggle between old staff and new staff. Some behaviors have gone o too long without any true consequences.

I work as an external consultant, and one question that has come up recently with a client's leadership team is whether it would be beneficial to remove the 1-5 scale (only for the self-evaluation piece).

I've tried to do some research on this topic and am not having any luck.

For background:

* This is a small but highly trained organization with minimal performance/employee relations issues (both on the manager and individual contributor side)
* There have been a couple instances of managers feelings employees have overrated themselves, and the manager feels uncomfortable to have that conversation.   


If they do keep self-ratings, they want an all staff live workshop on how to rate yourself with activities but I'm concerned that would come across as demeaning to the non-managers.

I'm looking for help with two things:

1) Organizational Development Resources (Podcasts, Blogs, Websites, Books, etc.)

2) Career Advice/Guidance

My story: I was a middle school health teacher and coach for four years, and received a masters degree in sport leadership &amp; coaching. I coached three sports as an assistant varsity coach. I transitioned to project management, where I have been a project manager for two years (IT Project Manager- Banking) and currently have two certifications: project management professional (PMP) and Professional Scrum Master (PSM). 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I've always been passionate about culture and developing programs and processes that create highly effective teams and developing an environment that empower individuals to reach their potential. I believe I have the necessary skills to make this transition (ability to educate and train people, experience coaching and executing projects, excellent at influence others and developing relationships), but could definitely use some guidance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking into graduate programs, and I/O has definitely peaked my interest. I'm considered doing a masters (I definitely don't want to do a PhD, at least not after my bachelors. I don't have a great interest in research). I already know what school I'm interested in- UHCL- the only problem I'm trying to figure out now is loans. I'm set to graduate my bachelors with 25k total loans, and taking out loans for my masters would cost around 50k total. That puts me at 75k after graduating with a masters in I/O. That's fine and all if I can get a decent salary. So I'm wondering, what does my entry level and median level salaries look like in Houston TX when it comes to pursuing a career after a masters in I/O? I'm considered being a consultant. Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Based on these replies so far, I honestly think my best option would be to work full time and take course work really slow, like doing one course per term. That'll take a long time for me to graduate (\~5 years) but I figure it's worth not stressing myself out with half enrollment combined with a full time job. And that way, I can probably afford to pay all the courses out of pocket (since I won't qualify for unsubsidized loans at that point). I'm sure I can work out some kind of payment plan (would cost about 4500/year). Thank you all for your insight, I really appreciate it and I'm excited to pursue this field.

The AMA will start March 15th at noon. Note that with the three day format Dr. Behrend will be checking every few hours vs shorter AMA events where someone may check every few minutes. This will also give people more time to ask questions. So it should be a fun 3 day event full of interesting questions.

Here is a bio from Dr. Behrend and some topics you might consider asking about:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a psychology professor at Purdue University, where I direct the Workplaces and Virtual Environments Lab ([wave-lab.org](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwave-lab.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cgschmidt%40ulm.edu%7C29225d8468644f50063208db19b1a4b8%7C90963b0cb03044fba95a9e359af4f668%7C1%7C0%7C638132022990059982%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=s26hEQ1pM41rSLjyLud5u8HVJxPR24Df1BEoooDm%2B0w%3D&amp;reserved=0)). I have previously worked for the National Science Foundation as a program director (the person who makes decisions about which grant proposals to fund), and I had a previous academic appointment at the George Washington University.  Lately I have been working on projects relating to workplace artificial intelligence, human-technology partnerships, and workforce development. I am a true scientist-practitioner, and I care about doing useful, practical, and ethical research. I will become President of SIOP in April 2023.

I'm looking forward to answering your questions about any and all of these topics:

Im a Talent Acquisition professional with 2.5 years of experience in recruiting and recruiting projects/operations. I graduated with a BA in Biology thinking I wanted to go into the pre-med track but transitioned to HR after graduation. The only relevant courses I took during college are intro to psych (A) and stats in psych (A). I also have exp in Biochemistry research for 1.5 years which I absolutely hated because all we did was work on flies and genes. 

For the past 2 years Ive been super interested in the I/O space and as time goes on Im becoming more sure this is what I want to do. In the long term I want to work in talent management, employee engagement, retention, analytics and more. But I dont know how to transition to the field.

I am part of a task force within my large (~4,000 employees) company to seek out avenues to improve employee engagement. We have broadly researched outside HR Specialists/Consultants, but are trying to narrow down our path forward. Currently, we perform an employee engagement survey once per year, but results are simply passed along by the survey provider for us to interpret on our own. The questions are identical for all companies that the survey is provided to, so some of the questions are confusing or not applicable to our business. This makes it difficult to actually act on results.

We are ideally looking for something more robust that may provide us with custom questions tailored to our business, along with analysis of the results and recommendations for improving engagement based on results. 

I know this is vague and a very broad question, but what would your recommendations be? Any companies or programs specifically that you would recommend reaching out to?",IOPsychology,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/146wz03/employee_engagement_in_large_company/

So. Essentially, we are surveying 9 different populations. 

I want to be able to show statistical changes over time for each population since the annual survey. I want to be able to infer the population from the pulse results. 


I was under the impression thst I would do a power analysis to determine this and that setting the power to . 08 is mostly standard, setting the effect to .5 is good for a medium effect and setting alpha to .05. 


Do you scale the effect size for each population by the populations standard deviation? 

Or, do you just go with the effect size of .05? 

Do you run finite point correction after you complete the power analysis on the smaller populations where the sample sizes from the power analysis are actually larger then the population?",IOPsychology,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/14620ke/questions_on_determining_the_sample_sizes_for/

6/4/2023,1685856459,How to Break Into I/O Jobs?,"Hello,

I'm currently an undergraduate student wanting to pursue a Master's in I/O in Canada. I was wondering if anyone could tell me a little bit about their career journey? Did you have considerable experience before your Master's? Were internships significantly helpful? Did you work your way up to a typical ""I/O"" job with HR-related/other entry-level jobs first, before you could apply the target ones you wanted? What did the journey look like for you?

Any help is appreciated.

6/4/2023,1685853312,Questions About Prospective Online Grad Program,"Hey guys! Hope you all are well and safe.

I am a student who just finished his undergrad with no courses in Psychology, but upon reading Psych/Sociology-related books and listening to Psychology-based people (e.g., Jordan Peterson, Adam Grant), I have come to realize that I love the Social Sciences - and especially this one - a lot.

Thus, I would like to go into a Psychology program ASAP and start my career. I am open to Clinical Psychology (I want patients) but I realize I may not be able to practice as I'd like until I get a Doctorate/PhD, so that route I can eliminate. Then, I/O Psychology seems very fun and intriguing.

So, for I/O Psychology, I found fully-online graduate programs which offer ""M.S. in Applied Psychology, Industrial/Organizational"" at Walden University and Capella University, each. I would not mind completing these as they do not require other undergrad prerequisites and can be done online, from my home state and city (where I would love to stay).

So, can you guys please give me advice on whether total online grad programs like these at Walden and Capella are fine for your future career? And, what job can I expect to get starting out right after Master's in I/O? Will this totally-online Master's degree, along with an internship, aid me in landing a good entry-level job relating to the I/O Psych field?

Please, please guide me on this. I would like to get into this field as I have really liked it and am a critical point in my life, deciding on my career.

6/2/2023,1685668276,Internships are Tough: An Overview of One Grad Student's Experience,"I've seen a few discussions come up over the course of time about internships (and found them quite insightful), and I figured I would share how my experience went as a first year grad student looking for a summer internship. 

I applied between February and early May (in hindsight, I should've started a bit earlier), and mainly focused my search in people analytics type roles, but ended up widening my standards when the fish weren't biting. I was searching both locally (major city) and for remote positions, but was unable to relocate. Over this 3 month period, I sent in a total of 51 applications. While I only got pursued with interest by 6 (12%), I was honestly pretty impressed by the overall response rate of 67%, even though 28 (54% total) application were just a rejection without an interview. I was definitely expecting to be left in the lurch (i.e., ghosted) by more than just 16 applications (31%; although for a few I never received an email, I had to check the portal. 

Of the 5 companies that I interviewed with, I went through the entire interviewing process with all (as far as I was told), and was formally rejected from 3 positions, never heard back from 1 company, and received an offer for 1 position, which I accepted.

All in all, for those in or entering similar boats, I would note the following:

* Don't give up--my internship offer came in at the absolute last hour after I had definitely given up all ounces of hope. And I still am seeing positions being posted even today, so keep on looking.
* Maximize all of your experiences--class work, work work, volunteer work, etc. I felt like a lack of relevant experience on my resume was what was really holding me back, but I think if I had thought more into projects I had worked on I could have leveraged those more.
* Don't read into every rejection--I hate the phrase ""everything happens for a reason"" but *sometimes* things do. One of the internships that I interviewed for was essentially my *dream* and when I got turned down it devastated me. Later, I ran into the would-have-been supervisor and had a poor interaction with them and all of that devastation washed away. 
* It doesn't have to be perfect--When I first started searching, I was looking for the ideal job description (ha!) because I wanted the perfect internship. Once I started widening my search and interviewing for positions that were ""less-than-ideal"" I realized how I could still apply my interests in different roles, they just weren't explicitly mentioned. And even outside of job tasks, there could be other things to learn you may not have realized. 

Good luck to y'all in your internship/job/school searches!

I'm in my late 30s, C-level executive in tech. The greatest enjoyment in my roles comes from a deep passion to understand people &amp; their motivations - team building, team dynamics, power dynamics, individual engagement and creativity, individual performance, positive psychology, conflict resolution, leadership, etc. etc.

I have done a lot of self-education on those topics and had good mentors along the way in the business world, but have never gotten any professional education. I LOVE school / learning, and have long thought about going back for a Masters.

I am unclear on the exact path here, I don't think I want to go into counseling/therapy, but I do want a stronger foundation of knowledge in the various fields of Psychology AND I would love some years of handson experience in Clinical Psychology - thought &amp; communication tools that I can bring back to the business world.

Long-term, I can see becoming an expert in some of those areas mentioned above, being an executive business consultant / executive coach, helping creating positive cultures, teams, and support individuals, bringing deep knowledge of individual psychology and team dynamics to helping create better work environments. This sounds a lot like I/O Psychology, but I'm not quite sure that's the right direction.

So I'm wondering if it makes sense to pursue a Masters and eventually a PhD/PsyD in Clinical Psychology, without the intention to go into clinical work full time in the future, with the intention of gaining knowledge &amp; skills &amp; credentials that I can bring back to the business world.

The William James PsyD program in Leadership Psychology seems very interesting to me, two questions:

\- There seems to be a lot of negative talk about these William James programs on this forum. Is that negative only in context of future Clinical/Research work, and maybe not an issue for someone who wants to go back to corporate world, or is this just a bad program?

Is there a response in the academic literature, summarizing the reasons why we shouldn't select on intelligence?

My rough thoughts would be something like:

* intelligence is nice and all, but which test/assessment you use to assess it matters a lot, because they vary widely in quality
* legal issues related to you not having a validity study proving that this is relevant in your particular job context
* legal issues relating to discrimination
* applicant reaction/face validity

EDIT: The responses to this question seem to roughly be:

* Some people think that testing GMA is illegal.
* Some people are concerned that a GMA test assesses the ability to take tests in addition to assessing GMA.
* Some people mentioned anecdotes of intelligent people who perform poorly at work.
* Some people stated that high intelligence is not beneficial for many roles.",IOPsychology,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/13e0b34/why_not_select_on_intelligence/

5/7/2023,1683442347,Is the GRE Worth It?,"Hello!

I'm kind of in a pickle situation. 

I am currently an undergraduate living in Canada. There are a total of 5 I/O programs in the country that I've found, at least; 2 of which require GRE scores for admission.  There are 3 closest to where I live; about an hour's drive away, and the 2 that require the GRE are part of these 3.  

I am not good at standardized tests. I have just started studying for the GRE but at the rate I'm able to proceed (while trying to properly absorb the quant concepts and make time for practice questions, on top of the fact that I am not currently able to attempt them myself), I'm not even sure if I'll be sufficiently prepared by the test date. Even if I am, I'm not sure how my anxiety would play out during the test. I know I've only just started but I'm not confident at all I'll be able to get a competitive or even good grade. I am worried and alarmed at how much math I've forgotten and am struggling to pick up at a faster rate again.

I am confident in all other aspects of admission requirements.

I am definitely going to apply to all the Canadian programs (including GRE-required ones given I decide to take the GRE). I have researched and am most likely also going to apply to some USA schools that don't require the GRE, such as Illinois Tech, Baruch, and New Haven. I am also interested in applying to some UK programs.

Is the studying and cost of the GRE really worth it? Would it be in my best interest to skip the GRE and therefore only apply to schools that do not require the GRE? Or should I go through with it? 

I'm not so sure what I should do. On one hand I feel like a loser for considering giving up so soon LOL but on the other hand I struggle with mental illness and this is taking a toll on me quite a bit. I just don't feel like I'm cut out for this, maybe because I'm Canadian and therefore don't take standardized tests often at all. I may just study a bit more and see how I feel after that...

5/2/2023,1683043052,SEM Help,"I recently conducted a survey of graduate students that included measures of psychological needs and motivation (from SDT perspective). 

I also asked for participants self-perceived performances among a group of 9 relevant metrics (e.g. academic, research, teaching). The participants were asked to compare their performances in those areas to that of their cohort on an below to above average scale. I also included an explicit N/A option since metrics are not always relevant to each graduate studentsome grad students don't teach or some don't do research. Because this is an explicit N/A option, I don't think it is appropriate to impute a value for the students who selected it (it obviously isn't MAR or MCAR). 

Because of the explicit N/As, I am unsure how to analyze the information. Here are my current thoughts about it.

1. If I was to do an SEM connecting the motivation scale to this (subjective) performance scale, I cannot treat the variables as ordinal because then the N/As would have to be tossed or imputed. I could treat them as nominal and convert it into a set of dichotomous variables but then that feels like it is wasting the information from the ordering of response options. 

2. I thought about treating N/As as equivalent to the neutral option in the scale but I don't know how justifiable that is. Some people might select N/A for teaching performance because they haven't taught yet (and would otherwise do well at it) or some people might select N/A because they chose not to teach because they thought they wouldn't be good.

3. Another option instead of direct SEM, I could convert participant's responses on the needs or  motivation scales to the corresponding factor scores from a CFA and then do separate ordinal regressions on each performance metric. That way, people only get dropped from the metrics they selected N/A for and not the entire analysis. 

4. One last option I have thought of would be to select a subgroup of the performance metrics to get a minimal amount of dropped participants. For example, I might select academic, conference attendance, research, and teaching for PhD students and do an SEM on those participants. And then masters students I could select academic, networking. and career preparation. My concern with this is my sample size of masters students is not particularly high (around 145) and I am unsure how the subgrouping would affect the stability of the latent variable. 

I would appreciate any opinions on how to best analyze this data.

So lemme get this straight when you create a simulation where the only possible relationship is a simple linear relationship with no possible interactions, a simple linear regression outperforms default tuned models that are designed to model non linearities and complex interactions?

With multiple acknowledgements of the systematic disadvantaging of MML techniques, why is it still acceptable to make practical recommendations for the adoption of MML in comparison to OLS regression based upon observations of differences in predictive accuracy, based on these results?

I guess my root questions are, does anybody actually believe that this simulation is reflective of reality, and if no, is it acceptable for the authors to make suggestions for reality based on the results when they are directly impacted by assumptions of the simulation?",IOPsychology,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1330sth/conclusions_from_landers_et_al_2023/

I want to ask if anyone has had an experience with DPD in the workplace. Obviously, one must recognise the scope of their profession, and it may be the best approach to refer the employee to a clinical professional. However, out of my own interest I wanted to get your opinion and insight into how the disorder may present itself in the occupational space?

If the status of the disorder has been disclosed voluntarily by the individual, how does management or us as professionals approach the employee? Or what can be done to manage this disorder in the way it manifests in the workplace?

I find myself at a crossroads in my career and could use some guidance. I have been working in HR for the past four years, but unfortunately, I have faced setbacks such as being laid off and fired, which led me to take on entry-level talent acquisition or coordinator roles. However, I strongly believe that pursuing an IO (Industrial-Organizational) degree could be the key to advancing to the next level and aligning my career with my passion for understanding human behavior.

Here's where I could use your advice. Due to personal circumstances, I am currently in between states, making it necessary for me to pursue an online degree. I would appreciate any recommendations or insights on reputable institutions or online programs that offer IO degrees. It is essential for me to find a program that provides a comprehensive curriculum and the flexibility needed for remote learning.

Another concern I have is my GPA, which stands at 2.7. I understand that GPA can be an important factor in the application process. Considering my situation, I am wondering if any of you have suggestions on how to mitigate the impact of a lower GPA when applying for IO programs. Are there specific steps I can take, such as acquiring relevant certifications or gaining practical experience, to compensate for a less-than-ideal academic record?

I am open to any tips, advice, or personal experiences you can share regarding transitioning from HR to an IO degree, pursuing online education, and overcoming challenges related to GPA. Your insights will be invaluable as I navigate this crucial phase in my career.

Ray Kurzweil predicts that AI will eventually be a billion times more intelligent than a human. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that AI will eventually be thousands of times more intelligent than a human. Let's say that an AI is developed in the next few years that is just three times more intelligent than a human. On an IQ test they would presumably score 300. The problem is that our current tests have a top score of between 160 and 200.

I plan to join a research lab starting fall to gain lab experience, and as our school has an abundance of psychology labs I will likely be doing multiple/different labs throughout the rest of undergrad

I will take the IO Psychology class and hopefully network with the IO Psychology professor who teaches the class, as well as join the campus psychology society and run for officer positions

I also want to apply for HR or data science internships each summer, however I am wondering how difficult it would be to land one as my resume is quite blank and even if I fill out some lines this school year I don't know if it would be enough.

I will be in the second year of my Ph.D. program.Looking back on my first year, I don't feel like I learned something meaningful.

I become more used to reading research papers and interpreting study results.

And now I can run multiple regression analyses, but that's it.

To apply for practitioner jobs, should I focus more on skills like Python or R rather than theoretical knowledge from research papers?

What do people learn from research papers?

Most of the time, I just skim abstracts and results except for some papers, and it feels like a little folly to exhaustively read every single paper.

I feel like skimming papers is just a waste of my time, rather than learning something new...

How can I be an expert in this field?

How can I be successful in this field?

I have identified assessment, training, and individual differences as my areas of focus.

Do you have any recommended books or papers for a good start in that area of expertise? Should I just read all the relevant papers available?

Or should I immediately purchase a DataCamp membership to further learn data analysis skills?

- The ethos in this field is that the care provided can never be ""perfect,"" and thus a 5 is unattainable.
- This got me thinking about the possible mental toll on workers - does being told that a top score is unattainable decrease motivation?

Im still a first year so I have a lot of time for changes but Im trying to start early and have a few questions if anyone would be willing to answer whatever they can :):

1. Is it viable to jump straight from an undergrad to a PhD in this field? Do PhD programs favor applicants who have a masters as well? Will I most likely have to go into academia if I do a PhD or can I still pursue applied roles (with a bump in the salary)?
2. Does my undergrad school matter too much when applying to grad programs? Same question for the degree: I was thinking that having a double major in relevant fields might help my chances but even to have business as a another degree incase I change my mind about I/O psych in the future. Does anyone have insight into this?
3. What is the outlook for international students/Non-US citizens to land roles in I/O psychology after a grad degree? Or to even find smaller, related roles right out of undergrad?
4. What do the exit opportunities look like after being in the field for a while?
5. Even with this degree, I want to earn certifications or learn other skills on the side. What types of skills should I try to learn that will help me for I/O psych?
6. Lastly, what specialization in the business degree would you recommend for me to pursue for an I/O psych boost, but also just in general incase I/O does not work for me?: Finance, Information Systems, Marketing, Economics. (Consider Job outlook and salary for these fields)

I am asking for some advice or resources for which I may not be aware of regarding my job search. I graduated in may of 2022 with a masters degree in IO psychology in the New York area from a brick and mortar institution. 

Before graduating I went to career services and had appointments with them to prepare for interviews and get my resume reviewed. It was helpful and the resume review checked out. I also started the search early about 3-6 months before graduating. 

Within 3 months of graduating I probably interviewed with around 8-10 different organizations related to IO psych or entry level HR positions but was never offered a position. 

After the initial 3 months post grad, I stagnated on the searchand had trouble getting interviews for a long period, mostly was using job boards, and occasionally opportunities from my school network. I wasnt very close during school with my professors or the other students, I now believe not networking back then was a massive mistake, which I didnt realize at that time. 

Since then Ive had periods where I stopped looking because it felt hopeless, but ultimately I dont want my entire degree and experiences to go to waste. It has been a long time since graduating now, but Im wondering if anyone believes I can still get a full time position related to the degree or even entry level HR?

Since that break, I landed an analyst role in September and realize I really enjoy this role. I work in nonprofit social services and not only is the day to day work enjoyable but I feel that the people I am working with are doing something I highly value, supporting the community.

 I am wanting to complete a Masters level degree but am unsure what degree would benefit me most. I am afraid to box myself into public health as an industry. The degrees I have considered are:
- finishing my IO Psych MA
- pursuing an MBA
- Data Science MS

I think each degree has pros and cons. I dont want to limit myself in any way. Given the job market post-covid, I feel its important to have a skill set applicable to many fields. I am skeptical of how much IO Psych will help me in the job market. When I look at middle management roles in Quality Assurance and Continuous Quality Improvement I never see IO Psych as an applicable masters. I typically see Public Health, Socia Work and Business Administration.

I've since taken an Organizational Development role (I do not see myself here long-term), but I'm also actively working two part-time consulting gigs. I'm seeking advice on breaking into the realm of consulting, especially at top-tier firms. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

**My Background**:

* Graduated with a 3.8 GPA in May.
* Gained real-world consulting experience from 7-10 case studies/projects during my master's.
* Worked a full-time Co-op at a top Aerospace and Defense company in my final year but was let go back in May due to a hiring freeze.
* Currently in an Organizational Development role at a major manufacturing organization.
* I'm also a consultant for a university and work on psychometric data analytics for a startup. As I mentioned above, these are both part-time contracted gigs. The university just extended my contract. 
* Recently networked with an individual from McKinsey &amp; Company, leading to a recommendation letter for me. I met this individual in person at a wedding event, and we seemed to have good chemistry over the 45-minute conversation. 

**Career Aspiration**: To accumulate enough experience and credentials to eventually establish my own consulting firm. Ideally, I'd love to gain some insights and experiences from big-name firms for credibility.

**Seeking Guidance On**:

* How did you get your break into consulting?
* Strategies to leverage an I/O degree when most firms prioritize MBAs.
* Networking and application tactics that have worked for you.

**Applications Status**:

* McKinsey  Applied with recommendation
* Bain &amp; BCG  Applied online
* Kornferry, Deloitte, Humu, Gallup  Applied and rejected

9/14/2023,1694714014,Master's in IO Psyc ( ~1.5 yrs post-grad) Looking for Job Search Advice!,"Hello all,

**TLDR:** IO Psych grad 1.5 years out had a 1 year job in tech learning and development, got layed off, now really struggling to get interviews and needs advice.

I graduated with my MS in IO in May of 2022 and after less than a year at my first job post grad, I'm on the search again! I am really struggling to get interviews and am starting to feel rather hopeless about this situation. I've applied to 52 jobs and have had one interview.

 In August of 2022 I got a job as a Training Consultant for a software as a service advisory company. This job was fantastic (for some of the time) fully remote work, flexible schedule, positive and psychologically safe culture, and the work was fun. About halfway through it became less great for a variety of reasons, all of which I believe were due to the fact that customers just were not buying the way they used to. I was impacted by the company's second round of layoffs in a short timespan. In mid July, I was let go with absolutely no notice. To make matters worse, I had just moved back to my home state of California where the COL is higher. The plan was for me to support my family while my husband finished school, it's incredibly hard to do that without a job! 

I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology with a minor in Project Management. I held a minor teaching assistant position for one semester, in which I taught students portions of Abnormal Psychology lesson plans. While studying for my MS in IO, I completed two internship experiences. The first was a general Consulting Psychology position, most of my experience with that centers on training development and delivery and assisting clients with selection and developmental activities through individual psychological assessment processes. In my other position, working as a Data Analyst at my university's Career Center, I evaluated the university's programs and procedures for effectiveness (I would liken this to Org Change or Org Development work). Additionally, I worked as a graduate research assistant conducting research in the area of work-life balance. This is the extent of my relevant work experience. While working for the SAAS company, they paid for my certification in *Prosci Change Management.* I'm a big fan of this and would love to use it wherever I go.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong with job search strategy. Here's what my current strategy consists of:

*  LinkedIn and Career Coach advice has told me laser in on specific jobs and tailor my resume and cover letter to those jobs, with small edits to fit the company culture and expectations of the job. I've done this - looking at positions like Learning and Development/Training Consultant **OR** Change Management Consultant. I am applying for internal and external roles.
* I am using Resume and Cover Letter templates given to me by a career coach I was connected with. Her services and associated resources are part of the severance package I received.
* After sending in an application, I'm using LinkedIn to reach out to folks close to the role in the organization. It consists of a friendly hello, communicating my interest in the position, asking if they have a contact I can ask questions, and of course thanking them. *This is the only reason I received the one interview I've had.*
* I am following up on applications if I have not heard anything back.

Where my frustration really lies is in the fact that I am not getting offered interviews. I feel strongly that if I can speak to a human, I can demonstrate my competency and passion. 

# I am looking for advice here: Have you been in a similar situation, what were your strategies? What strategies am I missing? How do I get interviews? I'd also be interested in advice on how to make connections.

* Each Quarter 1, my company surveys all employees with 81 questions, receiving a 75% response rate (\~5200 employees).
* We introduced pulse surveys, selecting 15 items from the original survey: 5 for executive-requested changes, 5 for employee sentiment, and 5 for values assessment.
* A priori power analysis was conducted to determine appropriate sample sizes based on desired effect sizes.
* An anti-clustering algorithm is employed to select representative samples, considering factors like career level, geographic region, tenure group, division, race/ethnicity, and gender.
* Once an individual is selected, they cannot be reselected for 1-2 months.
* Pulse surveys are conducted monthly, covering approximately 1/12 of the organization (effect size \~0.5 - There are more layers to this that I won't go into). 
* The goal is to analyze and compare the data obtained from the quarterly Q1 survey as well as track monthly trends.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem:

Non-response bias needs to be accounted for, as it affects the demographic composition in each round.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically, we have people who are taking the pulse who took the q1 survey and we can do a longitudinal analysis, but it won't give a full picture since there are people who didn't take the q1 survey and there are people who are newly hired and what not.

I have read that I can use a mixed-model analysis, but my concern is that by using the admin date of the survey as the fixed effect is in a way double-counting it and I am also concerned as the results will be more dynamic and less static. Executive will most likely question why results varied from last month if I did this approach.  I did read that I can do a design effect analysis, but I am cautious about how accurate that can be.

I feel like HR is better suited for my personality rather than consulting, but at the end of the day money is important and i dont want to be struggling  - however, I am also concerned about consulting being overwhelming / stressful / relatively similar pay to HR.

Has anyone been in a similar spot &amp; could provide some advice? I am applying for Summer 2024 internships to hopefully turn into full time offers but dont know whether to apply for consulting positions or stick to pure HR. I would apply to HR roles at big 4 accounting firms.

9/6/2023,1694025599,What would be included in the I/O Psych Iceberg? [Discussion],"For those of you who aren't aware, an Iceberg (or ""The Iceberg Theory"") in this case refers to a way of explaining a particular subject that covers a wide range of topics, from the commonly known to the esoteric. Using an iceberg as an analogy, the more commonly-known aspects of that subject would be at the tip above the water line. As the discussion ""submerges"" below, going deeper, the more obscure and maybe even abstruse the topic can get. [I've come across a few of these on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=psychology+iceberg) and thought it would be interesting to see what an IO version of this would look like.

Granted, the field is not very well known as it is, so we probably could generate maybe 3 or 4 tiers of solid content. And lord knows I am but one practitioner, standing on the shoulders of giants and a drop in the sizeable IO community with greater scope of knowledge. I'd love to see what folks here could come up with and how deep we can go.

Just to start us off, this is kind of how I might structure it:

**Tier 1:**
[The 101 stuff] Job Analysis, Performance Appraisal, Training, ""The Science of Work"", SIOP, Organizations, etc...

**Tier 2:**
[Various theories and well-known researchers] Goal-Setting Theory, ASA, Schmidt, Hunter, Barrack, Mount, etc...

**Tier 3:**
[Lesser known or emerging theories and research topics]

9/5/2023,1693958377,Collaboration VS Performance Management,"Hello everyone! Longtime commenter and first-time poster here. I've recently graduated and finally have some free time to delve into my personal interests. Currently, I'm reading the works of Edward Deming, who stressed the significance of collaboration over competition for achieving success in the market.

Deming strongly criticized Performance Management systems for their inherent challenges in measuring all relevant aspects without fostering unhealthy competition or devaluing certain skills. For instance, it's well-known in our field (referred to as Price's Law) that around 30% of employees typically handle 50% of the workload. However, this may not hold true when evaluating intangibles like ""Servant Leadership"" or addressing issues to support top performers within their roles. Deming advocates for a strategy that emphasizes collaboration, valuing each team member's unique contributions. Collaboration, according to Deming, is the only ***long term sustainable practice*** for business success.

In Deming's view, rewarding successful teams equally makes sense, as they all bring their distinctive strengths to the table; ***otherwise, why hire them in the first place****?*

However, I recently completed a compensation studies certificate that highlighted the importance of pay-for-performance to retain and attract top talent. While some case studies showcased the pitfalls of its incorrect implementation, resulting in the neglect of valuable skills like mentorship and project failure, overall, this approach proved highly effective when executed correctly, leading to significant project success, ***especially in the short term***.

I'm currently reflecting on the interplay between short-term and long-term strategies within these two distinct systems. I'm considering writing an article on this topic once I've clarified my thoughts, and I'd greatly appreciate your insights and any literary references to expedite my process!",IOPsychology,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/16b4pqx/collaboration_vs_performance_management/

9/4/2023,1693871204,How can IO Psychology be leveraged to fight the War on Climate Change?,"EDIT: Shouldve made this post more open-ended, sorry yall.

Im a recent graduate IO practitioner who just got his first job in a Fortune 500 company after 10 months of non-stop searching. Although Im elated to be joining this team, part of me cant help but worry about the outlook for humankind due to recent climate disasters and the fact that Im selling out to make money working for an industrial polluter. I felt as though my IO program and most of my cohort were unconcerned with the existential threat that anthropogenic climate change poses for the future of HR.

I do however, fully believe that capitalisms knack for motivating creativity can be mobilized to devise innovations to solve the climate crisis. The runway for it is just long and laden with (frankly) older people in leadership positions who are divorced from this reality.

The question I propose to this forum is this: How can we as IO practitioners pivot away from purveying practices that are destructive to nature and the environment in industries that have high path dependence on fossil fuels (e.g., compensating individuals for putting profits over sustainability, hiring individuals who are not climate-conscious, training individuals to pollute blindly, and consulting with businesses to find myopic solutions to problems that wont matter if we cant breath our own planets air).",IOPsychology,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/16a85v2/how_can_io_psychology_be_leveraged_to_fight_the/

I hope you can help me today.

I am an I/O graduate student in the planning stages of my Masters Thesis project, and I happened to come across an opportunity to conduct research with an organization interested in understanding how their workforce will be influenced in the next 5 to 10 years by technologies and other developments that bring fundamental changes to the way they work.

The agency has 10-20 incumbents/supervisors at a location convenient to me, some of whom would be interested/qualified to serve as subject matter experts, and about 50 incumbents whom I could survey too.

Given their interest and the resources available, I was considering a project that involves conducting some form of a strategic or future-oriented work analysis that would involve a) facilitating an in-person SME panel (focus group) to better represent the tasks they are asked to perform for their job and b) survey the larger group of incumbents to understand how they view these tasks as currently performed based on frequency, time, importance, etc. to how they view these tasks being performed in the next 5 to 10 years based on frequency, time, importance, etc. too. 

I understand conducting a formal work analysis can take too much time and I am wary of the limitations a small sample size poses, which is why I wanted to pose the following questions to the sub: 

1. What is the feasibility of conducting a project like this given what you know?
2. What suggestions do you have for someone who is attempting a project like this?

Hence, I was looking at IOP masters so that I can work with corporates, or even start my own consulting company and incorporate DEI into my policies and strategy making.

- Reducing academic performance to a single number (GPA) assumes that academic performance is unidimensional. Academic performance is probably multidimensional, although im not sure what those dimensions might be
- GPA is mostly used as a selection tool to decide who gets into college (or grad school). It is almost useless as a development tool and a more comprehensive measure of academic performance could give students better insight into how they could improve.
- Obvious reliability concerns. Grading standards vary between schools, courses, and instructors.
- Since any score 90% or above gets an A (4.0), GPA is almost useless for distinguishing high performing students. At the other end, all low scorers (below 60%) receive 0 grade points, so GPA is useless for distinguishing low scorers as well.

I currently already work in my field of choice (government) but our work culture and environment, specifically with the type of work we do (first responders) the organization needs an overhaul to say the least.

But now, am currently interested in a BS Business admin with a focus in organizational leadership.I also, want the BA in psych with a focus in I/O. 


My thinking is, I have been away from school for over 10 years. I'm only 32 but I was horrible in math, so the stats courses from the business degree  and the research experience from the traditional psych degree would help give me a better foundation to pursue a Master's or my dream, a PhD at CGU.

I've been quite confused about which career to select as per my personality. Its that I have not come to any conclusion yet that what my interests are.

I have read many materials to know what would suit me but when concluding i would not have the self-belief/confidence in it. I read a book based on DISC(surrounded by idiots) and it helped me where I would fall in personality dynamics but I am not able to trust it as my personality is still developing. I even tried to read some material on TA to help me with my ego state, but to some extent that has left me confused.

I just dont want to be wrong this time selecting a career as I have tried many jobs but could not fit in.

I study part-time and have been take classes in primarily behavioral neuroscience and statistics. I really enjoy what I've studied and wrote a paper on ""Cortisol, Stress, and the Health Impacts They Can Have"" for class. 

Why am I mentioning this in IO Psych? After I get through the biology of it, I explore how it's impacts people in their everyday lives and delve some into ADA law and then finish with how stress mindsets can impact the stress response and cortisol levels. (Context:  I came up with the idea myself and drafted an outline for the professor after some discussion.) 

Where this all comes together for me is that I suspect that going forward, reasonable accommodations in the workplace and classroom will take on a more preventative aspect than they have had to so far, especially when we consider the differences faced by people experiencing stress-related disease and/or are neurodivergent. 

S0...some science, some data analysis, some law and just trying to stick it all together to come up with better sustainable solutions for people...hopefully before they have to see a doctor.

12/4/2023,1701733723,Struggling to find job in IO after graduating,"Hello!   
(This is my first reddit post so I apologize if this type of posting is not allowed! I'm really just at the end of my rope with this and was not sure where else to turn for assistance).   
I was wondering if anyone could lead me in the best direction and/or provide any tips/tricks to navigating the job search field (a pick-me-up pep talk would be awesome as well as these last few months have been extremely disheartening).

I graduated in 2017 with a B.S. in Psychology, and worked for 5 years in a customer service role for a software company. I moved to the Boston area from Ohio to complete my degree in 2022, graduated with my M.S. in I/O May 2023. I was an intern full time for the summer in the L&amp;D department at an insurance company, but have not had any other I/O work experience as while completing my degree I worked a few positions on campus in order to have my school fees waived. 

Since graduating, I have been struggling to find a job anywhere in the field that does not require prior work experience along with a master's degree. It is getting to the point that I am nervous that I will have to move back to Ohio and live with my parents (which is not what I would like to do but I also do not want to burn away much more of my savings). 

My question: Does anyone have any suggestions on what I might be doing wrong, leads on better ideas for where to go for looking for a job, or better tips on my plan of action?

I've used the following websites to search for jobs: Monster, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, SIOP's website. I also did direct searches for the job positions on any local universities, hospitals, and businesses in the Boston area to see if they were hiring, but did not have any luck. 

I've kept a close network with my cohort and other connections in the field since graduating, but most of my cohort also seems to be struggling on finding something. I've also worked with hiring agencies but have not had any luck with them returning my calls/emails. 

My original salary range on was 60,000 - 70,000, but at this point I've lowered it to 52,000 - 62,000 as an attempt to hopefully get more offers (which I believe is a more than reasonable range with my Masters + living in Massachusetts, as my roommate works as an editor making 55,000 with a Bachelors, and I've checked O\*Net for positions that I'm eligible for and know I'm lowballing a bit on the amounts).

I have looked at all modalities for work, as while I would love to work remotely (as it would save me so much more $$$), I am desperate for anything. 

I have looked for positions mainly in Learning and Development, HR, and Talent Acquisition/Recruiting. 

In the last few months, I ended up working a part-time job waitressing to help make ends meet, but with winter coming on many places are starting to close early/have cut hours, and I am nervous that I will not be able to make enough for rent these next few months. I would prefer not to work in customer service on the phone again as I got my master's to escape working a job like that.

Any suggestions, tips, or tricks that I might be missing? Or any companies that you recommend would hire someone with a Masters in I/O but little work experience? (Also, any pick me up advice would be greatly appreciated, as these last few months have hit my mental and physical health hard). TYIA!

Update: After 7 months of searching for an I/O job, I finally got one! It ended up being at a local job coaching/recruiting firm, pays $60k, and it's less than a 10 min drive from my apartment. Honestly such a relief on all ends to have found something so close that I could walk there if I needed to! 
I ended up searching a local job forum for the city, and after reaching out to the business a few times and contacting the head of the program I was able to land an interview. I was later told by an employee that while me having my masters was impressive the manager in the meeting was most impressed and felt I stood out by the way I was able to communicate how my IO skills can be used to within this role + (oddly enough) my previous customer service experience and current food service roles.
 Thank you again for everyone who reached out with their kind words and advice!! It gave me such an extra needed boost, and I doubt I would've been as persistent on getting this position if not for that!

11/26/2023,1701013295,"I desparately want an accademic research career, but I don't feel set up for success due to a lack of social support.","Hey all, 

I will be graduating woth my PhD in organizational psychology - which is very different from the ""hard"" sciences. I am currently on the academic job market and have been getting interviews, but I am really not enjoying the academic experience overall. 

On the one hand, this is my dream career. I am a scholar who is interested in a wide number of scholarly fields - most of which are obviously beyond my specific field (and has admittedly made this a lot harder). It really feels like there is no other jobs where I can flex my creative and academic spirit. I love research and I want to make a fruitful career where I can contribute to addressing questions that are meaniful to organizations and to society. I know that I have ideas that can do this. 

On the other hand, my experience durring grad school has been terrible. But I've spent thousands of hours working on my advisors failed projects. I was ostracized by members of my department for having broader interests than their own, and for simply struggling with developing clear research ideas very early on. Though certainly not intended to be malicious, I've also been treated poorly and then ignored and unsupported largely due to having intense depression after starting to see things go so south in my program. Between being exploited in some ways, and other projects just not working out, I don't feel set up for success in a tenure track job. 

In general, I absolutely have all of the skills to do successful research. Nonetheless, I don't feel set up for success because I completely lack a supportive co-author team to help me get my works published. In my experience (and even that of my peers who have gone into R1 research positions) it really feels like thep only way to be successful in this job is to do it entirely alone - co-authors are only helpful durring the review process. Sure, it took me a while to reify my ideas and I certainly need more help in doing so, but I can't do this job entirely alone. 

Mind you that I am not the only person working woth my advisor and department who was not set up for success given the COVID cohorts. Our department has a strong history of developing successful academics and I am super privlidged to be in sich a resource rich environment with very successful scholar.  However, now the professors are all full profs and are relying on grad students to drive all of their projects. 

I love this job more than anything. I really felt that academia could be a place where I could thrive. I also thought it would be a place that would appreciate my broad palate if interests, and I thought that it would be a relatively safe place with pretty low stakes when it comes to making honest and human mistakes. My experience has been absolutely the opposite. 

I have given everything I have durring graduate school. I worked so hard. But I also have very bad depression, which is both due to my predisposition and due to being systematically undermined by my advisor and belittled by faculty broadly. 

Right now I am looking at R3 jobs that will likely inundate me with teaching. I love teaching, but I also love research. I'm burnt out and feel awful about myself and my work. I feel like my grad experience was terrible, I am not set up for success, and I am masochisticly trying to continue to follow my dream. Yet, though my wife is highly supportive of me, I am also risking uprooting our whole life to pursue a toxic dream. 

I want nothing more in the world but to pursue this job, but it hurts so much. Yet, I also don't feel safe moving into industry. Accademia is toxic, but many organizations are too. In general, people like working with me. Yet my depression, being gasslighted, and having a history of knowing some really toxic executives makes me very cynical about my life being any better in practice. 

I really don't know what to do. Should I accept academic jobs in a place that I dont really want to live and work? Should I continue an accademic job that may just perpetuate this trauma because accademia is not safe? Should I give up on this dream and take a job in industry... which may not be better? I feel like all I have are bad options in front of me and I don't know what to do.",IOPsychology,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/184devs/i_desparately_want_an_accademic_research_career/

2/27/2024,1709047237,Anyone with an M.S. in I-O Psych working in Operations at a Company? Career Question,"Hi everyone,

I graduated last May with my master's in I-O Psychology. I spend my 20s to mid 30s working in fundraising for nonprofits, then switched over to admin and executive support for a variety of companies like law firms and management consulting. 

I am currently in Resource Management at an accounting firm. I like it a lot, but the team is a bit disorganized and there is no clear leadership. The resource management department itself is just two years old. I thought I might enjoy the autonomy of being part of a younger, emerging division of the company but it is just sporadic and ineffective. We keep growing and hiring more accountants, and then hire more resource management staff, but without any transparency or consistency. 

I joined in April 2023 and did not receive any training for the role and it was a new position and industry for me (sigh). After a really serious talk with my boss about how I don't understand the business and how she doesn't have time for me, I am now teaching myself the role and doing what I can to upskill. 

Overall, I'm not doing a lot to really help my colleagues or create lasting impact like I thought. I mainly schedule projects, review billable time on timesheets, oversee utilization hours, and interact with our interns and new hires on a super intermittent basis. It is part of the human resources department and I love and gaining insight into that, but the passion on my team isn't there. 

The firm has an operations / project management office that works with organizational development, mergers/acquisitions, training, software licensing, and change management. It is really the ""nerve center"" of the company. They are very established with their policies, procedures, and best practices. The director and I spoke about an opening and she wants me to apply. Just wondering, does anyone has experience working in this type of role? It is a senior specialist, operations and project management. 

I do have some PM experience at the coordinator level before I went back to school, so it may be a better fit for me as well. I don't know exactly what it all entails but it sounds like an exciting opportunity. But, it won't be part of HR. Or, do I stick it out and try to keep ""proving"" myself to a boss who has checked out and just hope we gel better once I have been here longer?

2/17/2024,1708187391,How to proactively measure strain/burnout/employee well-being?,"Hello!

I'm doing a university project for an organization. They want to know how to proactively measure strain and burnout in a population of 100 employees from the same department. They also wanted to know which job demands and which job resources are abundant in this employee population so I have adopted a JD-R -model perspective. For reasons not dependent on me, I'm not able to use a survey to map the possible demands and resources and have to interview some of the employees to find out which demands and which resources they feel are present in their work. I know, this is not the best way to approach this question since I can not interview every single employee, the employees being interviewed may emphasize different job characteristics in different ways etc. However, since the JD-R -model/theory posits that different jobs have different demands and different resources, and the demands and resources of this population have not been studied before, maybe I can find some ""new"" job/occupation-specific resources and demands from the interviews. 

My line of thought is that by recognizing the key demands &amp; resources and monitoring them, strain, burnout and work engagement could be influenced. I know JD-R has it's own pitfalls but this is the best I can think of. 

However, I'm having a hard time to find any literature or studies on other ways to proactively measure strain/burnout before it turns in to sickness absences etc. The organization doesn't actively measure anything well-being related (at least in my opinion) so they really don't have a baseline for employee well-being. They use a regular eNPS-survey but I feel that it doesn't really tap anything relevant to employee well-being. Maybe it could be used as a predictive tool (?) but I think that if you feel burnt out in your job the lower eNPS-score is maybe a consequence of that and not something that accurately predicts lower well-being. Do you have any thoughts on this?

I also feel that measuring burnout/strain has some serious ethical considerations. Burnout measurements tend to be pretty long (how many employees would take the time to answer those?), hard to interpret/get interpret wrong (which I feel is dangerous) and altogether I feel a bit uneasy with the whole topic  burnout assessment tools include some pretty sensitive information that I feel could be used in wrong ways even though the survey process would be completely anonymized. 

Maybe a work engagement scale would be better? I feel that employees would feel ""safer"" to answer questions regarding vigour, motivation etc. 

My task is not to test which scales or methods of measuring work the best since I am only doing recommendations based on scientific literature. 

Do you have any ideas what kinds of measurements or scales could be used in a proactive manner that could actually be used in a group of 100 people?

2/16/2024,1708099092,Any advice for some grad students starting a pro bono consulting group?,"A few friends and I (all upper year PhDs) decided we want to start a consulting group that does pro bono work. Our program is in an excellent research school but the applied components pretty much died a few years ago when our more ""applied"" faculty retired. So some of us have never so much as dipped a toe in applied settings and would love to get some experience. 3 people in the group do have consulting experience though and will be shepherding the process a little more.

The idea is that over this summer we are going to focus on doing pro bono work (mostly with organizations that one of us knows personally or has family members running it) to figure things out. Then once the summer is over and if things went well, we might think about turning this into a real corp. We've got two psychometrics-heavy people, one leadership person and two ethics people. To be clear, we are not planning on having this group be in any way related to the university. There's no faculty mentor and we're not using university resources.

2/15/2024,1708006851,Deciding between social or cognitive psych supervisor for undergrad thesis,"I am an undergraduate student planning on pursuing a master's/PhD in IO psych. Next year, I will be undertaking an independent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, resulting in an undergrad thesis. In an ideal scenario, I would choose a supervisor whose research interests are most compatible with my goals, but unfortunately, there are no IO psychs in my uni's psych department, and of the remaining viable supervisors, their fit isn't exactly clear to me.

Social psych:

* Supervisor ""Social A"" studies how emotion and motivation influence attentive, cognitive, and social processes. They examine a range of emotive states and traits, including anger, jealousy, desire, sadness, and humility. They also examine conflicts between motivations from the perspective of cognitive dissonance theory. In general, they take a neuropsychological approach.
* ""Social B"" studies the ways that emotions both arise from and shape social processes. They focus on positive emotions such as pride and gratitude and outcomes ranging from prosocial behaviour to loneliness, and psychological wellbeing to relationship dynamics.

Cognitive psych:

* ""Cognitive A"" studies the psychological and neural bases of learning and motivation, particularly relating goal-directed action, reward learning, predictive learning and decision-making. In general, they also take a neuropsychological approach.
* ""Cognitive B"" studies the cognitive processes underlying judgment, choice and decision-making and the application of this knowledge to environmental, financial, medical, and forensic contexts.

From these descriptions, it seems to me that ""Cognitive B"" is the best fit. Judgement and decision-making seems to be more relevant to IO psych than the other options. But more importantly, the use of psychological research to generate practical insights in other fields looks exactly like the work of an applied or IO psychologist. Right?

However, I am concerned that there are differences more inherent to social and cognitive psych research that may be differentially useful to my future grad studies. For instance, differences in research methods, data collection methods, exposure to psychometrics etc.

In summary, I would like some insight into how social or cognitive psych may broadly relate to work as an IO psychologist (yours or otherwise), and if you were in my position, which of the mentioned supervisors would you pick and why?",IOPsychology,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1arghm3/deciding_between_social_or_cognitive_psych/

I went to college (U.S.) and ended up doing a BA in psychology. I knew early on that I would have to pursue a graduate degree to really get use out of my education, and I was okay with that. I went on to received a master's and PhD in I/O psychology from a respected program. I've worked at a few different external consulting firms, and overall the work is unfulfilling. I don't feel like my work really has any meaningful impact (e.g., job analysis, comp modeling, lit reviews, tedious computer tasks). I realize these tasks are important, but I can only get so excited about spending weeks sifting through job descriptions, etc. to build out a comp model that is likely going be shelfed internally, and have no real impact on anyone.

Overall, the work simply doesn't inspire/excite me. I meet people at conferences who act like solving problems in the I/O literature is what gets them out of bed in the morning. That is not me, and I wonder how much people actually feel that way, and how many are just putting on a face. I don't hate the work, and I realize some times work is just work, but lately I've been wondering if anyone else feels the same way about their job in I/O, or maybe it's just something that all people experience throughout their lives.

I day dream about the idea of just working at a retail store as a cashier, it honestly sounds less stressful and more social, but obviously don't pay nearly as much. With that said, I was wondering if anyone out there has felt the same way and ""abandoned"" their I/O training/background and switched careers to something else, what that switch was, and whether or not it made a difference, or in 6 months you are in the same spot all over again but with a low paying job.

There are several ways you can take this idea.

Put a lot into the UI on the participants side to raise response rate.

My supervisor called me in to say that she was very impressed with the work I've done so far. I'm considered an intern in the federal government due to my position, but I've had my MS for two years and am working on my PhD, so I've volunteered for work similar to what those 2-3 pay grades above me are doing - both in I/O and in HR.

Anyway, my supervisor asked me about my career goals. I enjoy I/O and am working on a PhD in I/O, but I also really enjoy the HR work I am doing right now, so much so that I've been seriously considering switching for a while. Also, my agency has ample opportunities for international work. So, I told her that I really liked being in the hybrid space of HR and I/O, and I was open to new experiences. She responded by saying she'd keep an eye out for a higher-level position - one that would almost definitely take me further out of I/O.

My mentor is retiring late this year. She's the only I/O psychologist in our department. We've been trying to find her replacement since before I started, but the requirements they're asking for are just too prohibitive to non-federal I/Os. I am too junior to be built into the role currently, so most likely, I would be supporting our replacement I/O in the meantime, if we ever get one...

Anyway, the main thing I am afraid of is getting so far from I/O that, should I decide to return to such a role, I would be too far removed from the field. I feel like that should not be the case given I'm still in HR, but I can't say for sure.

1/26/2024,1706309957,MBA and Master of I/O? Worth it?,"Hello all! I am currently pursuing my MBA (26F) with a concentration in Industrial Organizational Psychology. I have my B.S. in Psychology and in my undergrad I have published research so I am interested in research-heavy majors and using my skills for that. 

The reason I am doing an MBA is because I was not 100% sure of what I wanted to do and I am working in a professional field and have been since 20 so I thought it would make sense for me just to boost my resume to get better pay. Well, I want to get into I/O because all the jobs in that field fascinate me like no other. I also always had an interest in I/O and almost went for it instead of the MBA but thought I could be more versatile with the MBA. 

Now here is my dilemma: 

My current MBA with a concentration in I/O will leave me HALF way finished with the Master of I/O degree. I unfortunately cannot pursue both Masters at the same time. However, it will take me 2-3 semesters to finish the 2nd Masters if I wish after the MBA. My concern is, I really did not want to come out with more debt than I planned, this will result in me taking another year of financial aid. I am working full-time and work somewhere I can get loan forgiveness and plan on staying maybe even 10 years so I could possibly get the loan forgiveness but I don't know for sure. So really if I pursue the 2nd Masters I will be a bit financially strained for longer and adding another year of schooling on me (total of 3  years come out at 29 years old with these). I do love school however but at some point, I need to just be free. Should I drop out of my MBA and pursue I/O to save money and waste what I just did, or should I pursue both and get I/O after MBA?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",IOPsychology,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1948lj4/are_internships_in_hr_recommended_if_i_eventually/

I'm new here! I'm a 32 year old woman, based in San Francisco, who recently lost my job during the tech layoffs. I am considering returning to school to pursue a Masters degree in I/O Psychology (maybe at San Francisco State or out of state). This field was something that I was very interested in when I was finishing my BA degree in general psychology. I had good grades, was in Psi Chi Honors, and enjoyed my Human Factors and I/O-related classes. However, I was a broke and very disillusioned student back then with no real work experience so I pursued different opportunities.

After 5 years of project coordinator work, I am debt free now, built a great business network, and have a lot of savings for rent and tuition which is why I'm revisiting this old dream of mine. I'm interested in possibly being a researcher or consultant in the tech industry, preferably in gaming companies. I feel like this work would be more personally rewarding than what I used to do.

**Questions (open to DMs!):**

1. What was your I/O career path? (And salary if you are willing to share.)
2. What are some consulting firms that would be great for I/O psychologists to aim for?
3. What are some challenges that you face in your profession given tech industry recession fears and layoffs?
4. I understand that academic careers involve being geographically flexible. I plan to stay in the Bay Area/California for long-term, will this set me back quite a bit?
5. Not a Q but I'm also going to visit SIOP 2024 to attend workshops and talk to people to get a better idea of things and to enjoy Chicago.

Based on my research, it seems like the thing I probably should have studied in college - I just didn't know it was available to me at the time. I'm not exactly passionate about my ""first"" career path, mostly because:

1. I'm just looking at numbers all day, not really feeling like I'm helping anyone other my clients and their investors... or anyone, really. I think I'd prefer a job where I'm spending my work hours actually positively impacting people in some way. I've considered therapy/counseling, but unfortunately, it seems that the pay is not enough to sustain my long-term goal of having a family in a VHCOL area, so I probably need to stick with some sort of corporate job (for now).
2. The work hours are very variable and can be quite intensive. One week I could be working 40 hours, then out of nowhere I could be working anywhere from 45-60 hours or more for months on end if clients come in with a fire drill project. This makes it very stressful as someone who doesn't like unpredictability, and I know that my field has a tendency to have cyclical busy periods of 50-55 hours/week even if I moved to a job that wasn't client-facing.

My question is whether these two big dislikes about my current role are still applicable to most jobs in IO. Like my current field, I know that it probably depends on what you do with your degree (consulting vs. HR vs. people analytics, etc.), so interested to hear the perspective of people who are out actually doing the work day-to-day. Moving into IO would require me to probably take 3-6 months off of work to get the psychology course pre-reqs for master's programs done (looks like it's anywhere from 5-15 classes depending on the schools I'm looking at), then another two years assuming I actually get into programs. That's a huge commitment in terms of both time and money, so I'm trying to figure out whether this would even be a worthwhile jump overall.

I applied to the doctoral program at Rice and did not get in. I only applied to Rice because it is close to home and I have health issues. Now, as my issues get more complicated I'm looking into online programs for maybe just the first year so I can get better and then try for an on campus program.

As I read posts in here about the job market I get a little worried. However I also believe as more people discover that they are ADHD, and the more the employment landscape changes, there's just not enough research out there on workplace neurodiversity to support the evolution. 

Here's the thing: 
ªI was an art major in college which was 25 years ago so the struggle is real! 
ªI took the GRE last year even though I didn't have to and got a 309. Math sucked but I got a 5 for writing. 
ªI have no formal background in psychology, just a passion for it.
ªI have some certifications in applied neuroscience and I'm a certified ADHD coach.
ªI really don't want the program to be through a business school because I really want to learn more of the psychological dynamics.

I feel like online programs may be the way to go at first because of my health issues, but I also know that sometimes they are looked down on. I saw some people mentioning CSU and I've seen a lot of discussion on online for master's. I guess I'd like to get the thoughts of people who know the industry and know the programs. Is it worth it to start online and try to transition to on-campus? Is I/O the way to go for what I want to do? Any feedback is much appreciated!

To be honest, I only decided to go for the diploma because I wanted some time to actually think about which field I was most attracted to without feeling like I wasted my time.

I always knew I wanted to go for something in Psychology and while I was interested in (and enjoyed) learning about all the clinical disorders, I realized it wasn't something I wanted to pursue a career in.  We had a semester specifically catered to I/O psychology and it really got me thinking about the field in detail. I have researched about it and know that pursuing a Masters in I/O can lead to a lot of different job positions in theory but a lot of posts here kind of make me think that it isn't really true in reality.  It also has to do with the fact that many people here in India are not aware of the field or do not believe in its value and prefer an MBA instead.

I really like various aspects of I/O that I have learned about and want to know (study) more about them so that I can make a solid decision on my career after pursuing a Masters but I am hesitant to do so. I thought about trying abroad as well but the cost is not really worth the uncertainty. I also do not think I have the specs enough for it.

I recently finished a MSIOP degree last year. I understand the job market is cheeks right now. But its really starting to get to me. I have spent most of my adult life trying to get out of the family poverty cycle without going into a field that I was either not interested in or would be bad at. Fast forward to now and it feels like this degree was a waste of time. Overqualified for basic roles, but not enough experience for other roles. I dont have a large network to rely on because I literally could not invest the time with other family obligations on top of ASD. I know that typically those of us in poverty have more challenges moving up the social/income ladder, but when is something going to give. I refuse to let my ASD define me, but it creates unique barriers neurotypicals do not face.

I am in a bit of a predicament about where I should take my career. This past year has been incredibly difficult due to being sent back to my home country due to not finding a Visa sponsored job in the UK. For context; I completed my Bachelors in Psychology and Masters in Clinical Psychology (1 year), all from the UK. I stayed a further two years there working as a support worker in prominent mental health charities. I have always been passionate about psychology, and seemed like Clinical was the way for me. However, of late, I have been incredibly disappointed by the scope there is in Clinical Psychology, especially in the UK for International Students. I also do not think a future in the UK is going to be very good due to the current economic and political conditions.   

After some research, and speaking to ex-professors, they have suggested a PhD in I/O psychology as a way to transition into the field. I am in no way suggesting it is easier to pursue, I am well aware of the challenges a PhD will come with (e.g. financial stress, workload etc). However, I have always liked research and enjoyed my undergraduate and master's dissertation process. There are a few PhD courses in the Netherlands where they will give a salary to pursue this, which seems like a good deal to me.   

On the other hand, I have also wondered if I need to get some work experience in HR or I/O psychology before pursuing a PhD. However, with today's job market, I do not see a possibility of me getting anywhere with this without a long waiting period, which frankly I a cannot afford.   


Therefore, does anyone have any suggestions on whether this will be a good idea to pursue a PhD in the I/O field? Or would you suggest I find work experience in HR or I/O and work my way up? If i choose the second option, will it be possible for someone from a clinical background to make this career change - I am currently enrolled in some Coursera courses in HR and Organisational psychology to have that extra credential- but will this be enough.

That being said, I have just enough time to get a minor. I originally wanted to minor in stats, but I cant minor in stats without extending my graduation date by a semester or two (prerequisites). As a 30y.o who spent 7 years slowly working on their AA, the last thing I want to do is spend more time in school than needed. Im also going to be a TA for stats and research methods and so hopefully that will help for grad school applications. 

My advisor brought up getting a minor in business. I know business is basically a complete different field from IO psych, but it intrigues me because when I started my AA, I intended on going into business administration.

Anyway, my question is essentially this: would getting a minor in business with a major in psychology help me at all? Would it be weird? I have not heard of many psych majors with a minor in business, and before I start taking classes for the minor, I want to know if this would lead me to a dead end. 

Thoughts?

3/15/2024,1710472515,Am I paranoid or the job market is actually bad?,"Hi, I'm currently a 1st year MS in IO and will graduate this December. I got my first internship in my 2nd semester (my current semester) and have another lineup for this summer, I also sure that I will have an intern return offer at the company I currently work at for the Fall 2024 (so until I graduate). My current internship and the fall 2024 is Training and Development intern at a small company and they pay me $17/hr, which is not too bad cause I'm an international student and I'm grateful for what I can get. My internship for the summer will be in Total Reward and I'm super excited for the experience too.

Question: What job title in the entry-level should I look at when finding a full-time job after I graduate based on my education and experience? I would expect a salary of at least $65k and I currently live in Chicago, etc (I can't think of any other title that might match my intern experience so please please help me :( ) I have a Bachelor's in Psychology and MS in IO.

More question: What job title in the entry-level should I look at when finding a full-time job after I graduate based on my education and experience? I would expect a salary of at least $65k/year and I currently live in Chicago is it a reasonable salary for all of that? Is it too much to ask for the employer?

I also can't go back to school for the PhD because I'm really out of money and can't have any finnancial support so I really need to work.

I saw a lot of my friends can't find a single job and they graduated last year so I am honestly scared the hell out right now, I also saw people get lay-off almost every other month and I can't imagine how I'm gonna compete with them in the job market.

3/14/2024,1710454335,HR options &amp; PhD ?s. ,"Hello! 
I am graduating with a BSBA in Management and HR this May! Super excited.  I was planning to work in HR after graduation and save up/find a place to pay for my masters degree in something along the lines of human performance/IOPsych/ Leadership Development.  I have been lucky enough to get my Bachelors paid for through working (2 years of paid internships and way more of restaurants) and scholarships. So I have no debt right now. 

My question, because I like HR and what I've done so far, is is it worth it to get a PhD?. Is there anything I can do with it besides be a professor? I feel like I should have more first-hand experience somehow. Like I wouldn't be qualified, which is probably the case. 

I have my SHRM-CP, have participated in HR competitions, have been part of the RSOs, and my school and some others have no-cost programs but I am also not sure if I could not work for that long because I have bills and no people to help with them. 

Has anybody been through this before/have any advice here? I'm considering waiting for the next cycle, doing research and a full time job while I save up, and then possibly applying since my school is every-other-year anyway. I just wish I found out before my last semester started.

Mid-career faculty here at at R1 (tenured) in a medium-sized city. I've had a pretty successful research career so far in terms of pubs, awards, media features, etc. I would like to leverage my expertise/credibility into some consulting work.

I was wondering if anyone has experience or tips on finding clients starting from scratch (local or otherwise), besides relying on referrals. Any tips on cold calls? or events where I can market my services?

I realize some past posts on this topic. But I'm hoping for tips specific for established faculty interested getting into this space as a low\~moderate effort side hustle.

Also, if the answer is ""its a hyper competitive space where you won't find any success without serious effort"" then thats useful for me to know, too. I'll know that its not right for me. 

I'm looking for possibly a few clients that I can do fairly boutique/specialized work for. I don't want to start a business or manage a team or anything like that. Is this possible?

3/10/2024,1710079623,Types of IO jobs? ,"Good morning! 

Im 54 years old and have been an IT/Systems Business Analyst and Project Manager for going on 20 years. Ive been burned out for a while though and seeking to change career paths. I was going toward trauma counseling and was applying to MSW programs, but I came across IO Psychology. 

Many many years ago I was at a large companys all day new hire orientation, and a speaker got up who introduced herself as an organizational psychologist. Many of the things she said grabbed my attention and I remember thinking, that seems like a really cool career, and maybe I could help people in that way someday. 

She was a consultant, which is what Id eventually like to be, but Im guessing most folks dont start out like this? Im wondering about IO career paths and job titles. Internships or part-time roles while in school, entry level jobs, short-term consultancies, please tell me about any and all of it. Id love to hear about your job titles, your paths, even your goals for the future. I did look at SIOPs career track and Id like to aim for Expert Consultant but not yet sure how to get there. Once I get into grad school I plan to join SIOP as a student. 

Ill add that I have a BA in Humanities and various IT certifications. Im pursuing this because Im convinced that I can leverage my corporate/industry experience and combine it with my interest in helping people plus my love of psychology. IO Psych seems like the fastest and most effective way to work in the space between orgs and people to help meet the needs of both - is that statement correct? I understand that you are working for organizations, theyre the ones paying for your services. 

I would also like to work specifically for the oil and gas industry if possible because thats what Im very familiar with, but I think I Ill take what I can get for starters. What industries do you find are the most interesting to work in or are the most in need of IO services? 

Ive applied to the one year Angelo State online program. Theyve never actually graduated anyone yet, its very new. Accelerated intense program, no thesis or internship necessary. I had a long phone conversation with the program head on Friday afternoon to make sure my goals aligned with their program and it seems that they do, and she said theyd love to have me. 

Im realizing that a lot of these types of questions have already been answered elsewhere so Ill scroll back and do some reading. Apologies for redundancy. 

Ill also add that Ive done some Change Management work and currently working on Lean Six Sigma Certification. Hopefully these will help? 

Finally, do any of you teach adjunct or are you professors?
